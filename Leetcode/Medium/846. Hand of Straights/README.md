[Leetcode]()

Alice has some number of ``cards`` and she wants to rearrange the ``cards`` into groups so that each ``group`` is of size ``groupSize``, and consists of groupSize consecutive cards.

Given an integer array ``hand`` where ``hand[i]`` is the value written on the ith card and an integer ``groupSize``, return ``true`` if she can rearrange the cards, or ``false`` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3  <br>
**Output:** true <br>
**Explanation:** Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4 <br>
**Output:** false <brs>
**Explanation:** Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.

 

**Constraints:**

- ``1 <= hand.length <= 10^4``

- ``0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9``

- ``1 <= groupSize <= hand.length``

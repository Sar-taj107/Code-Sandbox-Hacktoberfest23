## 786. K-th Smallest Prime Fraction

### Click the link below for complete Explanation 👇✅

[Leetcode Solution]()

You are given a ``sorted`` integer array ``arr`` containing 1 and ``prime`` numbers, where all the integers of arr are __unique__. You are also given an integer ``k``.

For every i and j where ``0 <= i < j < arr.length``, we consider the fraction arr[i] / arr[j].

Return *the kth smallest fraction considered. Return your answer as an array of integers of size 2, where answer[0] == arr[i] and answer[1] == arr[j]*.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,5], k = 3 <br>
**Output:** [2,5] <br>
**Explanation:** The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:
1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, and 2/3.
The third fraction is 2/5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [1,7], k = 1 <br>
**Output:** [1,7]
 

**Constraints:**

- ``2 <= arr.length <= 1000``

- ``1 <= arr[i] <= 3 * 10^4``

- ``arr[0] == 1``

- ``arr[i] is a prime number for i > 0.``

- ``All the numbers of arr are unique and sorted in strictly increasing order.``

- ``1 <= k <= arr.length * (arr.length - 1) / 2``

[Leetcode Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker/solutions/5290243/easy-to-understand-2-different-approaches-sorting-java-solution/)

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in __non-decreasing__ order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where ``expected[i]`` is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array ``heights`` representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each ``heights[i]`` is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return *the number of indices where ``heights[i] != expected[i]``*.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3] <br>
**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** <br>
**heights:**  [1,1,4,2,1,3] <br>
**expected:** [1,1,1,2,3,4]

- Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** heights = [5,1,2,3,4] <br>
**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** <br>
**heights:**  [5,1,2,3,4] <br>
**expected:** [1,2,3,4,5]

- All indices do not match.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** heights = [1,2,3,4,5] <br>
**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** <br>
**heights:**  [1,2,3,4,5] <br>
**expected:** [1,2,3,4,5]

- All indices match.
 

**Constraints**:

- ``1 <= heights.length <= 100``

- ``1 <= heights[i] <= 100``

[Leetcode Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-i/solutions/5179001/simple-easy-to-understand-java-solution-beats/)

An array is considered __special__ if every ``pair`` of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different ``parity``.

You are given an array of integers ``nums``. Return ``true`` if nums is a special array, otherwise, return ``false``.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1] <br>
**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

There is only one element. So the answer is true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,1,4] <br>
**Output:** true <br>
**Explanation:**

There is only two pairs: (2,1) and (1,4), and both of them contain numbers with different parity. So the answer is true.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [4,3,1,6] <br>
**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

nums[1] and nums[2] are both odd. So the answer is false.

 

**Constraints:**

- ``1 <= nums.length <= 100``

- ``1 <= nums[i] <= 100``

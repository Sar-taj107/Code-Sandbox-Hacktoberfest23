## Type of Triangle II

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size 3 which can form the sides of a triangle.

- A triangle is called equilateral if it has all sides of equal length.
- A triangle is called isosceles if it has exactly two sides of equal length.
- A triangle is called scalene if all its sides are of different lengths.
 Return a string representing the type of triangle that can be formed or ```"none"``` if it __cannot__ form a triangle.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,3,3]   <br>
**Output:** "equilateral"   <br>
**Explanation:** Since all the sides are of equal length, therefore, it will form an equilateral triangle.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,4,5]   <br>
**Output:** "scalene"       <br>
**Explanation:** 
nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 4 = 7, which is greater than nums[2] = 5.
nums[0] + nums[2] = 3 + 5 = 8, which is greater than nums[1] = 4.
nums[1] + nums[2] = 4 + 5 = 9, which is greater than nums[0] = 3. 
Since the sum of the two sides is greater than the third side for all three cases, therefore, it can form a triangle.
As all the sides are of different lengths, it will form a scalene triangle.
 

**Constraints:**

- ```nums.length == 3```
 
- ```1 <= nums[i] <= 100```

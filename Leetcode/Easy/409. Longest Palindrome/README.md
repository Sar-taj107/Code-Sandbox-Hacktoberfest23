[Leetcode Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/solutions/5259747/simple-easy-to-understand-hashmap-java-solution/)

Given a string ``s`` which consists of ``lowercase`` or ``uppercase`` letters, return the length of the longest 
palindrome
 that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, ``"Aa"`` is not considered a palindrome.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abccccdd" <br>
**Output:** 7 <br>
**Explanation:** One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "a"  <br>
**Output:** 1  <br>
**Explanation:** The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
 

**Constraints:**

- ``1 <= s.length <= 2000``

- ``s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.``
